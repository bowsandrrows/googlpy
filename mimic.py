"""Mimic pyquick exercise -- optional extra exercise.
Google's Python Class

Read in the file specified on the command line.
Do a simple split() on whitespace to obtain all the words in the file. Rather than read the file line by line,
it's easier to read it into one giant string and split it once.

Build a "mimic" dict that maps each word that appears in the file to a list of all the words that immediately follow that
word in the file. The list of words can be be in any order and should include
duplicates. So for example the key "and" might have the list ["then", "best", "then", "after", ...] listing all the words
which came after "and" in the text. We'll say that the empty string is what comes before the first word in the file.

With the mimic dict, it's fairly easy to emit random
text that mimics the original. Print a word, then look
up what words might come next and pick one at random as
the next work.
Use the empty string as the first word to prime things.
If we ever get stuck with a word that is not in the dict,
go back to the empty string to keep things moving.

Note: the standard python module 'random' includes a
random.choice(list) method which picks a random element
from a non-empty list.

For fun, feed your program to itself as input.
Could work on getting it to put in linebreaks around 70
columns, so the output looks better.

(The task is to create a dictionary where each word from a text file is a key. The value for each key is a list of all the
words that come right after that word in the text. This list can have repeated words. For the first word in the text,
consider that it follows an empty string. So youâ€™ll be building a map of words to their immediate followers, showing how
words are connected in the text. Simple enough? Picture this: you're reading a text and you encounter the first word. In
your dictionary, you want to track what word came before every word, including the first word. Since there's no actual
word before the first word, you use an empty string as a placeholder. This just helps in creating a consistent format for
the dictionary. Think of it as a starting point, like a zero on a number line.)
